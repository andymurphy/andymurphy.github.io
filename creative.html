    <h2>Creative Computing</h2>
    <p>I am an active supporter of creative computing and its ability to provide learning environments which support people's learning and encourage learning through designing, collaborating, personalizing and reflecting.</p>
    <p>I first encountered the idea of creative computing as a primary school teacher when I discovered Scratch and tried it out with my classes, both in lessons and in after school coding clubs. You can find some of the work done my my pupils in the Scratch studios we created by following the links below.</p>

    <p>Scratch is developed by the Media Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and, determined to find out more, I attended two conferences there in 2012 and 2016.</p>
