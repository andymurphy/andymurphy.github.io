This repository contains the files for my new homepage which is built as a static webpage so that it can be hosted on Github Pages.
These are the that I plan to include:

1. An about me section
2. Some information about the projects I've done
3. An explanantion about my support for creative computing and its importance in education
4. Links to my profiles on GitHub, Twitter, LinkedIn, Scratch, and my prototype for an interactive for Ferens Art gallery
