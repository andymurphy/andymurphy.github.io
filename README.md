This is a project to demonstrate an interactive exhibit about TR Ferens for the Ferens Art Gallery in Hull.
There are different styles files as part of an experiment to see which style is better for galleries with different light levels.

The original styles.css with a white backgournd is for well lit galleries while the styles_dark.css file is for more cimly lit galleries.

styles_tablet.css is an experiment with displaying the interactive on a 10 inch tablet - a possible alternative to a Raspberry PI linked to a touchscreen monitor.
