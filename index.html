    <h1>Andrew Murphy</h1>
    <p>Computer programmer, learner and supporter of creative computing.</p>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Having a varied background in both retail and education, I recently completed a degree in computer science. I have always been interested in computers since I was a child, and although computers were never the focus of my work, they were always a part of my life and work.</p>
    <p>As a result of my interest in computers, I led a sales drive when working for Asda and supplied eighteen PCs to a local primary school for their new PC room. This led me into education, first as a volunteer and then as a primary school teacher where I was always the technical focal point for the school, initiating the use of new technologies, such as interactive whiteboards, into my teaching and sharing my knowledge with colleagues.</p>
