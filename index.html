    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Having a varied background in both retail and education, I recently completed a degree in computer science to become a computer programmer. From being a child, I have always been interested in computers and they played a significant role in my earlier work.</p>
    <p>When working in retail for Asda I led a sales drive and supplied eighteen PCs to a local primary school for their new PC room. This led me into education, first as a volunteer and then as a primary school teacher where I was always the technical focal point for the school, initiating the use of new technologies, such as interactive whiteboards, into my teaching and sharing my knowledge with colleagues.</p>
    <p>This forward-looking approach to the application of computers in education led me to discover Scratch, a graphical programming language for children developed by MIT. I experimented with Scratch in school, both in lessons and during lunchtime computer clubs and this reminded me of my own explorations of programming as a child. After attending a Scratch conference at MIT, I decided to study computer science.</p>
    <p>As a member of the Digital and Interpretation Groups at Hull Culture and Leisure I have explored the use of smartphone apps and interactive digital exhibits to develop the audience for the cityâ€™s museums and art gallery, and to improve the experience for the visitor.</p>
