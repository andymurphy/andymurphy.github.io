    <h3>Museum Interactive</h3>
    <p>In my work with Hull Culture and Leisure I have developed a touchscreen interactive using HTML, JavaScript and CSS whhich can run on a Raspberry Pi. This interactive was developed as part of the Ferens Art Gallery Interpretation Group and is designed to increase visitor engagement with the gallery by providing information about T R Ferens, the industrialist and philanthropist who funded Ferens Art Gallery.</p>
    <p>Explore the T R Ferens interactive by clicking on this <a href="https://andymurphy.github.io/trferensinteractive/index.html">link</a>.</p>
