    <h3>Museum Interactive</h3>
    <p>In my work with Hull Culture and Leisure I have developed a touchscreen interactive using HTML, JavaScript and CSS whhich can run on a Raspberry Pi. This interactive was developed as part of the Ferens Art Gallery Interpretation Group and is designed to increase visitor engagement with the gallery by providing information about T R Ferens, the industrialist and philanthropist who funded Ferens Art Gallery.</p>
    <p>This interactive was developed using Visual Studio Code, with GitHub used as source control. It's also published using GitHub pages so that it could be shown to colleagues for feedback. On the Raspberry Pi, it is loaded on start up by Chromium and viewed fullscreen in kiosk mode.</p>

    <h3>Android and iOS Audio Tour app</h3>
    <p>I developed this app to provide an enhanced visitor experience to visitors to Ferens Art Gallery. Developed as part of the Ferens Interpretation Group, it provides an audio description of selected works of art throughtout the gallery. This app was developed using Visual Studio 2019 and Xamarin, with GitHub used as source control. It uses the Xamarin.Forms MediaElement</p>
